# 100-Day-UI
This is a challenge in creating small UI components every day for 100 days to practice and hone my skills for web development and human-user interaction. Sometimes functionality may or may not be included as these are for UI practice. All of these are done with PURE HTML and CSS, no frameworks (Bootstrap/Chakra UI...)
